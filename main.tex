\section{Introduction}

When neutrinos interact with argon nuclei, in LArTPCs like MicroBooNE, SBND,
and DUNE, the hadronic recoil consists of charged and neutral pions along with
protons and neutrons. Understanding how these hadrons interact in argon is
important for accurately reconstructing the initial neutrino kinematics.  One
of the main missions of LArIAT is to measure the cross-sections of charged
pions on argon. This note focuses specifically on the pion absorption and
charge exchange pion interactions.

In pion absorption, a charged pion interacts with a nucleus to produce non-pion
hadrons. Protons and neutrons are the most common products of pion absorption,
but deuterons and kaons can also be produced~\cite{lads98,lads00}. Neutrons are
difficult to detect in a LArTPC because, as neutral particles, they only
produce ionization electrons when they interact with nuclei. Thus, observations
of pion absorption in argon rely on identification of protons, deuterons, and
very rarely kaons.

In pion charge exchange, a charged pion interacts with a nucleus so that the
pion's charge is added to the nucleus and a neutral pion is produced. Neutral
pions decay to a pair of photons, and the short neutral pion lifetime means
that they decay near the nucleus where they were produced. Thus, charge
exchange interactions are similar to pion absorption interactions, but with the
addition of two electromagnetic showers.
